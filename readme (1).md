1. Project Name

Lead Score case study for X Education

2. Project Description

We are given a case study to analyse the low conversion rate for the organisation X Education offering online courses for industry professional. It was observed that when a buyer or prospect visit the website, they either browse the course offered by the website or fill up the form or watch some videos. Any customer filling up the form is considered as a lead along with past referrals.

Based on the leads, the sales team of X Education start making calls or reach out to the customers through various other channels. Through these various modes of conversations, some of the leads get converted and some may not.
As the conversion rate are around 30%, so it pretty worrying for the senior management and looking for option to increase this.

A python code is written for a logistic regression to create model to calculate the lead score helping to determine how many leads will get converted to actual customer based on various combination of features selected.

A jupyter notebook is used to create the python code

3. How to Install and Run the Project

Need Anaconda navigator used for Jypyer notebook to write python code.

4. Credits

Used learnings from Upgrade IIITB material, videos and instructorâ€™s guidance to build the code create the presentations, summary and other.
